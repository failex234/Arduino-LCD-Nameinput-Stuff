# Arduino-LCD-Nameinput-Stuff
Enter any words or just characters to any 16 x 2 LCD (Should work 
with any, I just tested it with the LCD that got shipped with the starter kit)

# Disclaimer
This is one of my first arduino codes so nothing fancy
and as usual for me: neither is it clean not good documented.
Yeah the repository name sucks but I don't know what else I
should name this project
